Project 3

Topic
•	I want you to imagine you own a parts store
•	Design a menu driven program that manages your sales and inventory
•	The program will end only when the user selects a menu option to end
-	This means input validation and/or error handling
•	Minimum of 5 functions
-	Programs consisting of 1 large main() function with 4 single-line functions will not receive full credit. 

Database
•	Inventory will be saved in a "database" (make a file to read/write to)
-	Min required data: Item name, price, quantity on hand
-	DO NOT read from the database once and save it to memory and only use the memory
	I want you to read/write for every transaction! (where applicable)
-	DO NOT hardcode the information from the file into your program!
	Ex: If I add an item, I expect to see it in the sales menu

Sales & Returns
•	Your program should be able to process sales and returns
-	Sales should allow the user to pick an item from inventory, and a quantity to purchase
	For every sale, display the total price of the purchase
	You cannot sell more than your current quantity on hand
-	Returns should allow the user to pick an item from inventory, and a quantity to return
	For every return, display the total price of the refund
	A user can return as many items as they wish
-	Your program should update inventory levels depending on the items & quantity sold/returned

Inventory
•	Your program should be able to display current inventory levels
•	Your program should be able to accept new inventory
-	User should at least enter the min required data for the database
•	Your program should be able to remove inventory
-	User should be able to select an item to remove from the database




Hint: Here’s a sample of what the program output could look like…
